# Code Intelligence — Codesteward Graph

This project has the Codesteward MCP graph server connected (see `.mcp.json`).
It has already parsed this codebase into a structural graph.

## Prefer graph tools over filesystem reads for structural questions

When you need to understand code structure, relationships, or dependencies,
**use the graph tools first** rather than reading files directly.  The graph
gives you cross-file, cross-language answers in a single call; reading files
one-by-one cannot.

Use the graph tools for questions like:
- "What functions exist in this codebase?" → `codebase_graph_query` (lexical)
- "What calls `authenticate()`?" → `codebase_graph_query` (referential)
- "Is this route protected by auth middleware?" → `codebase_graph_query` (referential, filter on GUARDED_BY / PROTECTED_BY edges)
- "What external packages does this file depend on?" → `codebase_graph_query` (dependency)
- "Does data from this input reach a database write?" → `codebase_graph_query` (semantic)

Use filesystem tools (`Read`, `Grep`) when you need the actual source code of
a specific function or file after identifying it via the graph.

## Workflow

Before your first structural query in a session:

```
graph_status()
```

If `last_build` is null or the graph looks stale relative to recent changes:

```
graph_rebuild()
```

No arguments needed — the server knows where the repository is.

Then query:

```
codebase_graph_query(query_type="referential", query="authenticate")
```

## query_type reference

| query_type    | Use when you want to…                                                  |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lexical`     | Find functions, classes, or methods by name or file                   |
| `referential` | Find call/import/extends/auth-guard relationships                      |
| `semantic`    | Trace data-flow relationships                                          |
| `dependency`  | List external package dependencies                                     |
| `cypher`      | Write a custom Cypher query for anything not covered above             |

## Recording inferred relationships

If you identify a relationship through reasoning that the parser could not
detect (e.g. a dynamic call, a runtime-resolved dependency), record it:

```
graph_augment(
    agent_id="your-agent-id",
    additions=[{
        "source_id": "<node_id from query result>",
        "edge_type": "calls",
        "target_id": "<node_id from query result>",
        "target_name": "function_name",
        "confidence": 0.85,
        "rationale": "Called dynamically via registry lookup at line 42"
    }]
)
```
